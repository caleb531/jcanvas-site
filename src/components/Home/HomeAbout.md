### Seriously, what is jCanvas?

jCanvas is a JavaScript library, written using jQuery and for jQuery, that wraps
around the HTML5 canvas API, adding new features and capabilities, many of which
are customizable. Capabilities include layers, events, drag-and-drop, animation,
and much more.

The result is a flexible API wrapped up in a sugary, jQuery-esque syntax that
brings power and ease to the HTML5 canvas.
