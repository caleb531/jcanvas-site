If you'd like to submit a jCanvas plugin to the official jcanvas package, please [contact me](/jcanvas/support/#contact-me) with the following information.

- A link to the plugin source code
- A description of how to use the plugin
- Some code demonstrating how to use the plugin
- Anything else you'd like me to know

All of the plugins hosted here will be publicly available in the [jCanvas GitHub repository](https://github.com/caleb531/jcanvas). If you'd like me to publish a new version of your plugin, [submit an issue](https://github.com/caleb531/jcanvas/issues).
