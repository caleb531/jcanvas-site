The jCanvas package (from npm or cdnjs) includes a number of supplementary "plugins". These plugins use the [jCanvas plugin API](/jcanvas/docs/extending/) to implement custom drawings that have jCanvas powers.

If you're interested in submitting a jCanvas plugin to the official package, please see [the procedure for submitting a plugin](/jcanvas/plugins/submitting).
