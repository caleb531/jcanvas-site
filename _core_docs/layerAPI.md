title: Layer API
---

The jCanvas Layer API provides each canvas with a set of layers that you create. These layers provide a higher degree of interactivity on the canvas.

Each layer can contain only one drawing (rectangle, arc, image, *etc.*). This is because each drawing *is* the layer object itself.
